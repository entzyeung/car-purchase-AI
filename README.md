# I built this sample page with many with python, html, pyscript, and bootstrap.
I have already trained 2 more models - Xgboost, and Lightboost, with optimization simply by number of iterations, and max depth, but as at the time of deployment pyscirpt seems still not supporting Xgboost and LightGBM libraries, so I am forced to dropped them. 
In this webapp, I employed 2 simpler models which are Logistic Regression and Gradient Boost.
